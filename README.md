Website that mimics a desktop calculator.

## Use

Details of how calculator processes some operations are detailed below:
* Operations are calculated based on order they are entered into calculator. For example, entering sequence '1+2*3=' will return result 9. In this example, 1+2 is resolved before multiplying by 3.
* 'C' button will clear the result of last calculation. 'AC' button will clear all data currently stored in calculator.
* Square root button will return the square root of the number currently visible on the screen. Square root calculation will be resolved before resolving any other operations. For example, entering sequence '1+9(sqare root)=' will return result 10. To get square root of 1+9 instead enter sequence '1+9=(square root)'.
